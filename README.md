## Goals
1. Data Visuals:Â Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
	1. Metric 1: Average Bike Rentals and Returns Per Hour in a Day
	2. Metric 2: Average Trip Duration by Passholder Type
	3. Metric 3: Bike Efficiency - Number of Trips and Total Trip Duration by Bike ID
2. Which start/stop stations are most popular?
3. What is the average distance traveled?
4. How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?
5. (Bonus) How does ridership change with seasons?
6. (Bonus) Is there a net change of bikes over the course of a day? If so, when and where should bikes be transported in order to make sure bikes match travel patterns?

## Design
1. Data Analysis using `pandas`
2. Web App created using Dash (Python framework built on Flask, React.js, and Plotly.js)
